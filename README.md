# Title: 
Analysis of the relationship between the extent of COVID-19 and the developed level of countries

# Description: 
Our goal is to find out the relationship between the extent of COVID-19 and the developed level of countries. We use two factors to indicate the extent of COVID-19, the confirmed rate, and death rate. And we use factors in four aspects to reflect the developed level, economy (GDP per capita), education (excepted year of schooling), lifespans (life expectancy at birth) and mobility and communication (Internet user percentage of a country).

# Hypothesis:

1.The GDP per capita has positive linear relationship with COVID-19 confirmed rate and death rate

2.The expected year of schooling has positive linear relationship with COVID-19 confirmed rate and death rate

3.The life expectancy at birth has positive linear relationship with COVID-19 confirmed rate and death rate

4.The Internet user percentage of a country has positive linear relationship with COVID-19 confirmed rate and death rate
